I work 4 days/30 hours a week. I have never been healthier.,"All throughout school and work i have been susceptible to illness from burnout. I'm exhausted and pushing myself day after day, week after week. I would constantly get colds and depression. At least once a year in winter id get some terrible weird illness like strep type C or a bronchial infection that would knock me tf out for 1 week+.

I started a new job last year that i love, has a lot of freedom and flexibility. I work tu-f 9-4 and holy shit does the Monday off make a huge difference! Plus the 9 start vs 7:30 start im used to. My house is clean, im healthy, im feeling happy. Im not living in a state of constant overwhelm. 

I almost got sick a couple times (ominous throat tickle) but I said NO, ate a bag of clementines, and recovered! I haven't been sick in over a year, which is a record. I used to be constantly sickly for entire winters and catch every bug imaginable. Like a frail Victorian woman who needs time by the sea 

My mental and physical health are way improved. But im too poor to buy a house or start a family. I'm finally at almost 30 feeling mentally and physically well. Trade offs....",185,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kg426q/i_work_4_days30_hours_a_week_i_have_never_been/,1746536963.0,21

What do you do in your free-time? Do you waste it like me?,"There’s so many things I want to do in my free time. I want to read more things, watch more things, play more things, actually study for my classes, but in reality I just end up spacing out and doing a whole lot of nothing. 

Like recently, I get home from classes excited to continue my reading, and instead I waste my time on social media checking notis constantly, maybe listen to some music, get bored and fall asleep in the early evening, sleep for too long and spend the next day too tired because I’m screwing my circadian rhythm up.

I’m just so unproductive, I can’t even do the things I like, let alone all the things I want to/need to do. 

So what does everyone else do in their free time. I’m sure some of you have some really cool hobby’s you love. Are you able to do the things you enjoy, or do you struggle to, like me? Perhaps you used to struggle like me but found a way to overcome this? That would be hopeful.

"Those of you who have successfully quit nicotine, was it worth it?","Don't get me wrong, I know the health and financial benefits are definitely there, I'm not denying that. I mean productivity wise.

There is a noticeable difference working with nicotine in hand and without it, I can focus longer and somewhat direct it better than when I'm not using nicotine. Granted, I know that the days I don't have nicotine I'm feeling withdrawal symptoms hence me not being able to work as hard, but I do just see it as another stimulant I can take that will help me focus.

Has quitting nicotine made a change in your productivity/willpower? I don't mean during the withdrawal stage, that's obviously going to be tough, I mean once the fog has cleared. On that note actually, how was withdrawal for those of you who have quit?

I've stopped vaping and use a relatively healthier form of nicotine, but its still not eliminated. I keep telling myself that its justified because nicotine is something that is known to help people with ADHD focus (to a degree, with obvious negatives), so I've kind of held off on fully quitting.

I feel like I should mention that I haven't been using nicotine in place of medication, I never will and I am medicated. I also do not mean to glorify nicotine, take it from someone who uses it, I wish I never started.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments! Having all you lovely strangers say in almost perfect unison ""Yes, quitting is one of the best things I've done"" has really cemented in the fact that I am going to quit, within the next couple of days. I always knew that I should, but hearing people acknowledge the difficulty and mention the plethora of benefits to quitting has really helped.

A way to explain ADHD that I've found effective,"You can try to explain it in terms of executive dysfunction (which they rarely if ever can empathize with or understand) or you can try another way—framing and examples of how our minds work.

One that has weirdly resonated: different camera lenses.

Most people have a standard 35mm camera lens for information. They can zoom in and hold focus there, but can't see whats immediately around that focus/aren't distracted by it.

ADHD is like a fish eye lense. I see the bigger picture, but also struggle to zoom in and maintain focus with all the surrounding noise.

The result is better pattern recognition, creativity and big picture thinking, empathy, etc. But I can't stay zoomed in on things, which can be a weakness in certain work roles and environments.

Whats worked for you, explaining to friends or partners etc?",2236,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kfkozu/a_way_to_explain_adhd_that_ive_found_effective/,1746473702.0,295
I can't get myself to do 'The Thing',"I haven't met with my therapist since February. Why? Because my insurance information changed in the new year and I had to call her office and give them my new insurance card information. For some reason my brain tells me I have to set up a dentist appointment first because that was on my list to do before I needed to update my insurance info with my therapist. However I really hate going to the dentist and also can't get myself to call and make an appointment even though I do want to. I do want to take care of my teeth and all that. But whenever I am about to sit down and call and make an appointment I think to myself ""well I should probably get better with my flossing first so when they floss my gums don't bleed."" 

So at that point, I can't see my therapist until I get better at flossing. Somehow I actually did keep with it and have gotten better at flossing, but now it's been so long since I was supposed to see my therapist that now I feel too embarrassed to call and be like ""hey remember me from 3 months ago? yeah here is my new insurance info."" And THEN now I'm nervous my therapist won't have open space for me and that I'll have to get another therapist and I really don't want to have to do that. 

Logically, I KNOW that taking even more time to do it won't help anything. Thinking it through, I do KNOW that I really should just DO THE THING. But oh my god it is SO hard to do so. There have been a couple times I convinced myself to sit down and do it but then got distracted by something and I can't even remember what.

Anyway I guess this is mostly a vent/rant hoping that after posting this I'll feel like I can do it now. Or maybe other people will have words of wisdom or tricks that helped them 'do the thing'",39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kgaed9/i_cant_get_myself_to_do_the_thing/,1746552601.0,26

ADHD and 'Stonewalling',"So I recently discovered the word for what I do when I get overwhelmed/ jealous even since a kid. I guess I really try to avoid it and looking back I always get embarrassed that I do this. Does anyone know any methods they use to try to avoid this? I just sort of get overwhelmed and go full 'turtle' mode and try to run away from something that overwhelms me. I just can't seem to conquer it. For anyone that doesn't know its when you shut yourself away from people and just stop talking or communicated when you get overwhelmed. I know it's childish but I just can't help it and I feel like it's going to ruin my relationships in the future if I continue.

Meds make quitting nicotine even harder.,"Hello, i’ve been diagnosed with severe ADHD, and i’m in high school. (F) I take Vyvanse for my ADHD, which has been amazing, but one side effect that i’ve noticed is that it makes me crave nicotine 100 times more. 


I’ve been vaping for 2 and a half years now, it smh biggest regret but nowdays most people do it. I’m genuinely beyond terrified of the negative side effects that come with smoking in the future but I just literally can’t quit and i’m thinking it’s due to my meds.

If i skip a day or two of my meds, i barely even think/crave nicotine/smoking, but 95 percent of the time when i do take my medications the second it begins to kick in i start NEEDING to hit a vape, and if i don’t have one accessible i’ll begin to feel depressed all day….

Im in such a weird spot because without my medications i truly can’t function, and i need them for school, but at the same time when im on them it feels so much harder to quit.

Has anyone went through something similar, and if so did you overcome it and how? 🙁",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kg7lz0/meds_make_quitting_nicotine_even_harder/,1746545908.0,28

I’m very impulsive so i’m terrible with my finances and i’m just unable to do anything. I cant sit down and commit myself to anything even if its something I should enjoy, I cant sit down and watch a tv show because ill get distracted and next thing I know its too late, I cant play a game for more than 20-30 minutes without getting bored, nothing is able to hold my attention. I find myself doing absolutely nothing on my days off of work and even on days I work I wont do much leading into my shift, i’m just not sure what to do.

I’d love to hear how meds helped some of you. Also, i’m not sure how to go about getting meds?

Do meds help you read better?,"I have an ever-growing collection of books which I have yet to finish - or even read. The Final Empire, Discworld, The Great When, War Of The Worlds and The Brothers Karamazov to name a few examples. I've grown to really like books and it sucks that its so hard to focus on them. I have the usual issue or having to re-read the same sentence over and over again to get anything from it, but I also struggle with audiobooks. I tend to zone out when listening, go back 30 seconds to hear what I missed, zone out again, miss the same part, go back 30 seconds, repeat. Its made experiencing books really difficult and I hate it.

Kind of Weird ADHD symptom,"There is this odd thing I do that is kind of hard to describe and I can’t remember seeing mentioned anywhere and so I’m not sure if this is my ADHD or just some other weird thing my brain does for a different reason. 
We all know that we forget to things, for instance I often forget to close cabinet doors. But do you ever not doing something but with irrational intention instead of forgetfulness? For example, I find myself leaving the fridge door open if I got something out of it to use and plan to put it back in there afterward. And not because I forgot to close it, it’s like I actually have to talk myself into closing it in between. Like an internal argument with myself on whether to leave it open or close it… but for what reason? There is literally no reason to leave it open. Sometimes I think it’s due to coping mechanisms I’ve created.. like maybe fearing if I don’t leave the fridge door open then I won’t put the cold thing back in the fridge where it belongs.

how do i get taken seriously?,"I'm really struggling with the idea of seeking an ADHD diagnosis, and honestly, the things that make me suspect I have ADHD are the same things that make it so hard to ask for help executive dysfunction, fear of rejection, overthinking, etc.

On the outside, I probably look like I’m doing fine. I’m in my last year of high school, getting average grades, but privately I’m really struggling to keep up. I relate to a lot of inattentive-type ADHD symptoms and some impulsivity too. It’s taking a toll, especially since this year is crucial for getting into my dream university. Without support or answers, that goal feels more and more out of reach.

I’ve tried opening up to people about it some with ADHD but I’ve sometimes been met with defensiveness or comments like I’m being dramatic or making it harder for “real” ADHD folks, which honestly feels unfair since I haven’t even been assessed. My siblings have diagnosed ADHD, but they’re all very hyperactive and did much worse in school. Because I’m more reserved and internalize things, they just don’t believe me when I try to explain what I’m going through.

It feels like the only way to be taken seriously is to completely lay bare all of my insecurities, and that’s terrifying. I don’t know who to turn to or how to even start the process. I want to book an assessment myself, but I’m scared I won’t be believed or worse, that I’ll be told I’m just lazy or overthinking it.

Sometimes I feel okay, motivated even and then other times, I’m hit with this overwhelming sense that nothing matters, and I can’t see a way forward. It’s like my mind flips a switch and everything feels grey.

I’m not sure if this is just part of ADHD, or if it’s something else riding alongside it (depression maybe?), but either way, it’s draining. I’ve tried routines, meds, distractions, even pushing through it, but it always circles back.

If you’ve been in this place, how do you handle it? What actually helps? I’m tired of feeling like I’m floating through life without any real direction or connection.

How do I make tell my (F 29) husband (M 27) that I think I’m entering a manic episode? I can feel myself entering a manic episode. I have never noticed the manic episodes. Like many people with this “affliction” it just feels normal, in a sense I am happier during the manic episodes so they become somewhat a comfort. I look forward to them; however, this depends on how intense the “lull” or depressive episode was before the mania. This time I was extremely depressed.

We met while I was in a manic episode and then we both “settled down”. I am stressed because I don’t know how he will perceive it once it happens. I can casually say “hey I think I am entering a manic episode,” but I don’t think he will truly understand.

* The difficulty to manage my time
* Falling in the doom scrolling
* Be really disorganized and chaotic in my environments
* Been pretty difficult to respect a dead line, with procastination
* and many more

I'm also finding really helpful my way to study or to arrange things that I found out are used to be suggest to the person with this disturb, 

(I have to admit that some of them are from social and I think this type of techniques are pretty useful also for the non-ADHD person because are relate to the efficiency).

I'm already taking some contact and appointment for making some test to be sure of to be ADHD, but in the while time I feel pretty insecure of a lot of things that I was considered sure,

I can do it I won’t be limited by my own brain but why am I still in this bed ? tomorrows another day is what I said for three days and guess what’s tomorrow today? My bloody final . I’ll pass I always do maybe I’ll get an A if I’m lucky. But this ability to pass without doing anything is a crutch to actual hard work that will get me places and what I goddamn want. I know what I’m doing wrong will I get out of bed? No. I have every bloody reason to do so, I had the focus to type this rant but not the energy to do what I need? Help me. This is me trapped in the body that doesn’t move, when I send this out and and couple minutes I won’t care anymore. When I see the responses I’m going to be embarrassed I even sent this out.

"Norepinephrine/Noradrenaline — stress hormone? Nah, peace hormone for me","So I always hear that norepinephrine (or is it noradrenaline? same thing, right? 😅) is supposed to be a *stress hormone*. People seem scared of it like it's gonna send them into fight-or-flight mode.

"When they hit you with the ""is everything okay at home?????""","It’s so frustrating to hear. I don’t usually tell people about my ADHD, especially at work, or in this case, during my internship. I’ve been interning for three months now, rotating between supervisors every two weeks. At the end of each rotation, when I get my evaluation, there’s always a variation of the same comment: “I didn’t want to ask, but sometimes you seemed a bit out of focus and really forgetful. I wondered if you were struggling with something at home. Is everything okay?”

It’s exhausting. To be fair, Im good at my job and genuinely try my best. I just make the occasional careless mistake, in a very typical ADHD way. But those comments, especially the ones delivered in that fake concerned, condescending tone really bother me. Like, just tell me what I did or didn’t do objectively. Critique me like a normal adult. Why try to psychoanalyze or come up with a dramatic reason behind a few lapses?

1 Week No Medication,"I wanted to share my experience with managing my ADHD without medication for a week in hopes to find people with similar experiences to this.

i ran out of medication and couldn’t refill it until today because my insurance coverage changed. ive managed my adhd (without knowing) for 20 years without meds because i was undiagnosed until this year. 

while i still had my meds and took them at the time i am prescribed, id notice the medication felt like it worked 50% of the time. this led me to believe my meds weren’t working but in fact they were. i was organized with my coursework schedule, able handle my workday, even read things and retain information. dealing with my adhd without medication for a week slapped me in the face because i didnt ever “feel” my meds work when i took them. i relied on older and negative coping mechanisms to get through this week. my mood has been all over the place and my executive dysfunction is at an all time high. 

my questions for everyone: 

has anyone else doubted their medication’s effectiveness and have been humbled when they didn’t take their meds for a period of time?

& 

why do my adhd symptoms seem worse now,(while unmediated) compared to when i didnt know i had adhd and handled it without medication?

A meditation/calming technique I accidentally stumbled upon.,"I’m sorry if this is a “no-duh” kind of situation, but it’s a breakthrough for me. Hopefully it can be helpful to some others here.
I have tried many times over the years to meditate. I used to think that it should involve clearing my mind, being completely empty of thoughts. Well, obviously that’s not going to happen, especially not with my ADHD. I have a constant stream of visual and audible noise going on in my head, and trying to suppress it all is like trying to grab smoke.
Here’s what eventually worked for me. Instead of eliminating the sensory flow in my head, I fill it with something benign. Specifically, I imagine a circle that expands and contracts with my breathing, and I think “in” and “out” as I do so. This “blocks” the passages that are normally filled with complete chaos. I give them something boring to do, rather than trying to ignore them. This lets my mind stay busy while also letting me find some peace and quiet. Obviously my mind will want to wander away from the circle, but that’s just part of the practice. And I find it’s much easier to bring my thoughts back to a thought rather than pushing my thoughts down.
This technique has helped me sleep when I otherwise struggled. And it has helped me to calm down at times when I need it.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kg67ed/a_meditationcalming_technique_i_accidentally/,1746542514.0,1

"I'm 16, I have no idea what's going on, please guide me","I never really understood ADHD, and neither did my family. I was always a bright student, barely studied, and still got top grades. But around Year 10 and 11, everything changed. My old habits, like procrastinating and leaving things to the last minute, stopped working. My grades dropped, and my parents thought I was just being lazy. But I wasn’t. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t focus or start anything. And I hated myself for it.

In Year 11, I came across some ADHD videos. At first, I dismissed it, but the more I watched, the more everything made sense. Online tests said I was highly likely to have ADHD, but when I told my parents, they shut me down. Even my school’s psychology teacher dismissed it as either anxiety or attention seeking. I felt more lost than ever.

I still don’t have answers, but I know something’s wrong. I can’t focus, I can’t finish tasks, I procrastinate endlessly, and even when I want to study, I just freeze. I forget simple things, zone out in conversations, and constantly feel exhausted even when I’ve done nothing.

I don’t know if it’s ADHD, anxiety, or something else. But I feel broken, like I’m stuck in a loop I can’t escape. I don’t want attention. I just want help.

28M. Clueless about career interests and constant fear of failure.,"I began with a degree in Industrial Engineering, then spent three years preparing for competitive exams without success while working in real estate to support myself. Later, I moved to the U.S. for a master’s degree, where I was diagnosed with ADHD. It has now been a year since graduation, and I still have not secured a job. The repeated rejections have taken a toll, draining motivation and confidence, and leading to serious thoughts of moving back to India. I carry a heavy sense of guilt, feeling as though I have wasted $100,000 of my parents’ savings, with no clear path forward in a career aligned with my education.

Through all of this, I have come to recognize something important: I have a natural ability to connect deeply with people one-on-one. I can sense how others are feeling, and many have told me I bring a healing presence. Still, I do not know how to turn that into a meaningful career. I often feel paralyzed by fear, whether it is interviews or committing to a specific path.

I understand that every journey is unique, but growing up in an environment of constant comparison makes it hard to accept where I am now.

I think my BF is ADHD but he refuses to look into it,"I (23F) was diagnosed with ADHD a month ago. I knew I had it for literal years but wasn't in the correct situation to pursue a diagnosis/medication, but I researched almost everything there is to know about it. 

My BF (23M) and I have been living together for nearly a year now, and up until recently I assumed his behaviour was completely normal, mainly because I was the exact same way. But now that I've begun taking medication and therapy, I've realised how dysfunctional his behaviour actually is. 

He is the living embodiment of the term ""I'd forget my head if it wasn't attached to me"" he never completes a task, he has very poor memory, he has awful executive functioning skills, preferring to do tasks at ridiculous times rather than when it's reasonable (etc. Mowing the lawns at 8pm). He is dishonest, I've caught him in numerous lies about things that are not worth lying about. Lastly, he has the worst case of goldfish memory I've ever seen. If he's making a sandwich and has opened the fridge to get butter, something will catch his interest and he will abandon the whole task. Butter melted on the bench top, and fridge door open and beeping to be closed.

It is a nightmare, more so now because all the things he blamed me for in the past, was actually his doing almost completely.

I asked him if he's ever considered getting tested, and he immediately got defensive and said there wasn't anything ""wrong"" with him. I mention all the things that he does, I also did, before I got the help I needed. And that there's no shame in just being checked out. Best case scenario is that I'm wrong. He is adamant that I'm wrong, and that he will not be ""wasting his time and money"" on looking into it purely for my comfort.

He claims that he's just forgetful, and that I need to back off in analysing his every move. Does anyone have a similar issue? Or is he right to tell me to back off?",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kfwqpa/i_think_my_bf_is_adhd_but_he_refuses_to_look_into/,1746508584.0,33

ADHD and Executive Dysfunction,"Hey everyone, 

I am struggling with executive dysfunction like everyone else. I was diagnosed late in 2023 and I'm in my late 20s. As a child I didn't relatively have the problem since I had structure and a relative concurrent routine. However as an adult, I struggle to get things done, or even create a routine because I can't be consistent. 

I have tried everything. From reminders, to creating a visual checklist, to constantly keep moving, never sit down until I am done with the task. 

But what kills me currently is mornings. Especially weekends. I guess I used my entire battery of masking and acting somewhat ""normal"" during the workweek that I am exhausted come Saturday and I just end up rotting in bed rather than do all the things I told myself I would do the previous night. It sucks and then suddenly it's Sunday and I didn't do anything on my to do list. 

So what tips and tricks do y'all have? I'm tired of being a sucky adult and not able to do adult things.

how can i combat or get rid of adderall nausea,hey yall so i’ve been on adderall for 5 months now and it’s working wonders for me. recently though it’s been making me super nauseous maybe like 2 or 3 hours after taking it and it almost always makes me throw up atleast once or twice when i get that nausea wave. the nausea is super overpowering too like it gets b a d. i have problems with chronic nausea to begin with because ive got gerd as well but i can tell this is the type that’s actually forcefully caused by something and its not my typical type of nausea that happens because of the gerd. i can’t figure out the source of the problem and wether i eat beforehand or after taking it i cannot seem to avoid it and i even take zofran but that only seems to help the nausea subside for a little bit then comes back on again. i do take it with otc acid reflux medicine like omeprazole and pepcid because it helps it kick in better and i take them daily anyways because of the stomach problems that already exist. i thought the acid reflux medication would actually help prevent this from happening but obviously not. is me taking it with the acid reflux meds the issue? i thought it was food consumption or lack there of before taking it but that doesn’t seem to be the issue either. can anyone help? does anyone have this same issue??? it’s becoming a very prominent and annoying thing and i just cannot stand it with the nausea i already deal with.  ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kgd2aj/how_can_i_combat_or_get_rid_of_adderall_nausea/,1746558994.0,4

Still waiting for increased libido.,"Recently diagnosed. Started Adderall at 5mg, now at 20mg 2X per day. My libido was already down to zero after a different psych before this one refused to treat for adhd and started me on 4-5 months of Zoloft. 

Killed my libido and gained 20 lbs. Then he added Wellbutrin. Did that combo for two months with zero improvements after 6 months of treatment so I found a new psych.


I’m on month 5 of adderall. It’s working in regards to focus. 

BUT I still have a healthy appetite and no libido recovery. I expected the opposite, perhaps I have not reached my perfect dose?

How’s your libido?

48 yo male. 

Edit: I never took the Zoloft or Wellbutrin again. 5 months of Adderall with no other meds.

Advice with meds,"hi guys! lately it's been getting harder and harder for my body to function and I think it's because of the anxiety from all these years. that's why I've decided to start taking meds.

 I don't want meds for adhd though, (i'm autistic too) sometimes adhd causes me to be anxious , and maybe a bit obsessive but I'm okay with that, i like it. 

so I think it's all the anxiety that has been building up the years prior to my adhd autistic diagnosis and I want meds to help me with that until I feel a bit better.

  
do you guys take meds for anxiety or depression? any advice? I've got an appointment with the doctor next week.

  
P.S: I don't blame adhd / autism in the present because I've come to terms with it, it's just that a few years ago my mom got really sick and passed away, also I forced myself to play piano without enjoying it for many years and that made me feel miserable too.

Anyways. I decided to let ChatGPT give it a go and I'm really impressed with how it arranged my day. It even gave me reasons for doing it the way that it designed it.  

So, anyone that is having issues with building a schedule give ChatGPT a try. I'm thinking that I should use my Scheduled app to give me the reminders/prompts to keep me moving througout the day - I'll spend the rest of the day setting this up.

Parenting Two Kids with ADHD — Need Advice Managing a Toddler While Struggling Myself,"We recently welcomed a baby boy into our family, and we also have a 2.5-year-old daughter. I truly love being a parent — it’s meaningful and fulfilling in ways I never imagined — but I’m also finding it incredibly difficult to parent effectively while managing my ADHD.

Now that we have two kids, I’m realizing just how much ADHD impacts my ability to be the kind of parent I want to be, especially for my toddler.

Here are a few areas I’m struggling with:

	•	Maintaining structure: I know toddlers thrive with routines, but I struggle to keep consistent schedules. Time blindness and executive dysfunction often throw off our day, even when I start with the best intentions.

	•	Modeling emotional regulation: I want to teach patience and calm problem-solving, but I personally have a hard time with frustration, especially when I’m overwhelmed or overstimulated. I’ve started to notice my daughter imitating some of my reactive behaviors.

	•	Staying present: It’s difficult to slow down and fully engage in play or bedtime routines when my mind is racing or I’m feeling restless. I often feel guilt when I realize I’ve been distracted or short-tempered.

Now with a newborn in the mix, my cognitive load feels maxed out, and I’m worried about how this is affecting both kids.

I’d really appreciate advice or insights from other ADHD parents:

	•	How do you manage toddlers when you’re already stretched thin by ADHD?

	•	Are there any systems, tools, or mindset shifts that help you maintain consistency or stay calm during tough moments?

	•	How do you repair things after you’ve been impatient, distracted, or dysregulated?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kg9xwn/parenting_two_kids_with_adhd_need_advice_managing/,1746551508.0,2
Methylphenidate and alcohol. Seeking help,"I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD (late diagnosed female adult) after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression for decades. As a teen and young adult I was pretty much impulsive and enjoyed going out to parties and drinking. Later in life my impulsivity slowed down although peaked at times . I’m currently more on the inattentive side which is somewhat good for me because I don’t end up getting drunk and behave inappropriately. After my diagnosis as a 33 year old, I was prescribed Ritalin 10 mg x2.5 daily (morning, lunch, and half in the afternoon). I immediately felt like a “normal” person and did not have any alcohol cravings whatsoever although craved smoking a lot more. Due to shortage, I am currently on long realise Concerta 36mg in the morning and sometimes take Rubifen (10mg) in the afternoon to focus better on my studies. I’m currently doing a PhD in Social Psychology. However, what I realised is that I am currently not only smoking much more but also want to drink a lot of alcohol. I am ashamed to admit that I have a bottle of wine on my own  and feel like a complete failure due to this. Bear in mind that I’m also taking Vortioxetine (20mg) for my depression and anxiety. I will talk to my psychiatrist about this however really want to hear honest thoughts from people who may be able to relate to my situation. Any advice? Help? Guidance? I would really appreciate it.

I disgust myself.,"I hate myself.  But there are aspects of myself that I do like. I can empathise a lot with people. Probably that's all I like.

I hate almost every aspect of myself and my life. I hate that I lose every friend that I try to make. I push people away. And almost always lose friends eventually.  Maybe because after a while they realise I'm boring or maybe because I don't put as much effort in as I did before. I'm super introverted and anxious. But sometimes I do manage. But overall I'm terrible at conversation.

I don't feel motivated to do stuff. But I want to try stuff. I feel so down all the time. And anxious too. I'm tired. Even if I really want to I can't get myself to do anything. 

I can't seem to eat well or workout. I might lose my relationship. I keep thinking I'm not good enough for him ( he's amazing). I'll bring him down with me. 

I can't even seem to do the smallest thing I decide. Let's say I want to hit the gym. I break it down, wake up early. But I can't even seem to do that.

I can't retain any information. Even it's a hobby. The plot of a movie I liked...or the actors involved, I forget everything eventually. 

These aren't isolated issues. Everything affects the other. And if I don't maintain all, I get pulled down by one issue or the other. I can't seen to get out of this cycle.

Sometimes being kind (to others AND yourself) actually pays off - a small win,"Last night I came home in a good mood and found my teenage daughter with ADHD still playing Minecraft at midnight on a school night. Instead of immediately getting frustrated (my usual reaction), I asked how she was doing.

She confessed she couldn't bring herself to make her bed with the clean sheets, despite wanting to. When I went to help, I found what I call an ""ADHD nest"" - a chaotic collection of everything that had accumulated there over who knows how long.

Normally this would trigger me big time, but tonight I chose compassion instead. I helped her clean up without judgment, gave her a hug, and sent her to bed feeling supported rather than shamed.

Then I went to my room and found... my own ADHD nest waiting for me. At first I felt sad that I didn't have someone to help me the way I'd helped my daughter. But then it hit me - I could be that person for myself too.

So I cleaned up my space with the same patience and kindness I'd just shown my daughter. Went to bed feeling pretty good about breaking the frustration cycle, even if just for one night.

Just wanted to share this small win. Sometimes choosing the kinder path (even when it feels harder in the moment) actually leaves everyone feeling better, including yourself.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kfxnxe/sometimes_being_kind_to_others_and_yourself/,1746512370.0,1
ADHD and Bipolar Disorder in Adulthood: Clinical and Treatment Implications,"article dated 2021  
From [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8151516/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8151516/)

ADHD and Bipolar Disorder in Adulthood: Clinical and Treatment Implications  
In a Swiss study on 138 BD patients referred to a specialized mood disorders clinic, around half of them scored positive on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale. However, a correct diagnosis of ADHD was made in 20% of patients, suggesting that the overlapping symptomatology between ADHD and BD could lead to false positives when using a screening tool.  
   
**only a few studies have addressed the efficacy and tolerability of these psychopharmacologic interventions in subjects with ADHD and comorbid BD. Specifically, a point of debate relates to the possible induction of manic episodes in patients exposed to ADHD medications such as stimulants or atomoxetine.**  
   
Adults with ADHD and comorbid BD are a particularly critical group of patients showing a severe and burdensome clinical picture, with a lower quality of life, a higher number of mood episodes, an increased prevalence of substance abuse and dependence, and a worse overall functioning. **In spite of that, only a few studies have investigated the best treatment modalities in these complex patients, therefore recommendations should still be considered as preliminary.**

I’m Gianna Rosello, a 19-year-old creator with ADHD. Recently, I was struggling to learn a new subject I had no interest in, wanting to spend all my time consuming content of my hyperfixation instead. But this gave me the idea, what if I could combine the two?

I have been gaslit so many times when it comes to my emotions I can’t tell if they are within normal or just an overreaction.

Dose increased,"Yesterday my psychiatrist increased my medication to 50mg Adderall XR. I’m thankful for the increase since it was desperately needed but from what I’ve read it seems like 50mg of XR is a fairly high dose.

Is there anything I should be looking into to be sure the dose isn’t affecting my body in negative ways? I know Adderall can sometimes cause heart issues and such. Is that made worse by a higher dose?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kg54j4/dose_increased/,1746539810.0,1
What do I do if I've missed my meds?,"I missed my meds today, usually take them around 6am, only just realized now and it's 3pm, I'd imagine the answer is just wait it out til tomorrow, but at the same time, I'm gonna be so useless today, what do I do?

Does your partner know your ADHD med dosage/schedule?,"I’m wondering how open people are with their partners about their ADHD medication, specifically dosage and timing. Do you let your partner know when you’ve taken your meds, and how much? Or do you keep it to yourself?

Personally, I tend to keep it private. If someone asks, I might even lie and say a lower number than what I’m actually taking. I’m not proud of that, but it feels easier than having to explain or justify it. I’m currently on both Vyvanse and Dex, and sometimes I feel like if I gave the full numbers, it would sound like “too much” to someone who doesn’t really understand ADHD or stimulant dosing.

But I’m also questioning whether this secrecy is actually serving me. Would it be better to be fully transparent, or at least more open, especially with someone I live with or am in a long-term relationship with? Do other people share their full med regimen with their partners, or is it common to keep it vague?

Curious to hear what others do and what your reasoning is.",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kfnhps/does_your_partner_know_your_adhd_med/,1746480431.0,46
huge anxiety/panic attacks,"Hey, I've been under Medikinet for the past 6 months and It's been great for the productivity side, just a miracle. I still have my moments but it's part of me and meds help me a lot to cope with it. Although my mental is awful under methylphenidate (suicidal, anxiety, panic attacks, tachycardia) most of the times (for the past 1/2 weeks It's been unbearable that's why I'm reaching out with this post) and despite this I'm not willing to give up on methylphenidate due to It's effectiveness, I'd be on the streets without it. I used to be on SSRI's (which could've helped to contrast medikinet's side effects) and I had to give up due to side effects combined with methylphenidate (serotonin syndrome?) and I'm currently tapering from benzos so there's really nothing I can take to contrast the side effects. I was given some natural herbs (Tractana) but they do not seem to help. I tried Atomoxetine before getting on stimulants but I'd still have panic attacks and HUGE mental sedation to the point I could stare at the wall for hours. I experience this ""sedation"" on medikinet too but It's less noticeable and most importantly it's part of the rebound effect, meaning that I still get to benefit from medikinet for a good amount of hours before collapsing, I try to benefit from this by making it coincide with bedtime. I'd love to try Vyvanse/Elvanse but It's not approved in my country. There's a little chance I could try Amfexa (recently approved) but I'm afraid the anxiety could get worse due to it being stronger and I'm already in a HORRIBLE state.

"Your diagnosis is meant to explain your behavior, not restrict it","Yes, people with ADHD tend to struggle with math, but that doesn't mean someone with ADHD can't become a great mathematician. Yes, ADHD makes you very distractible. But that doesn't mean you can't develop a system to minimize distractions. 

I know ADHD is a spectrum, and some folks have it more severe than others. I don't mean to undermine anyone's struggles or in any way imply that ADHD is all in our heads. 

This is more so a message to myself than anyone else in particular. 

Before getting diagnosed, I just assumed I wasn't as naturally gifted as my classmates, and I had to work harder to achieve the same results. I went from being a B- student in high school to being in the top 4% of my class in med school. 

I noticed that, after being diagnosed and getting on medication, I began to struggle more and more with staying disciplined. It was like my symptoms, which I had previously had a pretty good handle on, suddenly became much harder to control now that I had a name for them.

And I noticed that, on a subconscious level, I suppose, some part of me was telling me, ""Ah, what the hell, I'll just keep doomscrolling through YouTube Shorts. My ADHD is making me do it."" Which really perplexed me, because I thought getting diagnosed was going to help me understand and control my habits. But instead, on some level, I sometimes use it as an excuse. 

Again. ADHD is real, and it makes everything more difficult. I really hope this post doesn't come across as minimizing anybody's struggles. Maybe this post applies to no one but me. But I know that there are no unique experiences, and so, if this is something I noticed about myself, someone else is probably going through it too. 

Your diagnosis is meant to help you develop the right systems to achieve your goals, not narrow them down.",1397,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kew523/your_diagnosis_is_meant_to_explain_your_behavior/,1746397371.0,130
Is extreme fear of judgement and being perceived + social anxiety an ADHD thing?,"The best way I can explain it is that I have an issue with being perceived by people. I'm a chronic ghoster and I never have real life friends for more than a few months. I'm only recently an adult but the few jobs I have I always end up quitting after a few months as well. Even just when I'm shopping in the grocery store I have intense anxiety about everyone who so much as glances as me and then I never want to be seen there again. I will even go out of my way to go to different grocery stores so I never go to the same one twice in a row. With the friends I do have, I'm almost controlling with what I do and don't reveal about myself because I want them to perceive me in specific ways, and when I reveal a part of myself that I didn't intend to on accident I will freak out and stop talking to them for days (besides a few very close friends that i'm comfortable with). I went to a small school yet almost no one knew my name by graduation time because of how much I avoided people. I'm overly insecure and I don't even mean about my looks, if I so much as talk about one of my interests I'm just flooded with regret.

  
Could this be an ADHD thing? I know I have anxiety but I'm just wondering if anyone could relate. It's an obstacle i'm really just now starting to try to overcome as it's setting me back very far in life. This isn't meant to be a rant or anything, genuinely wondering if this could be associated because I've been diagnosed my whole life but only recently did I start taking meds and educating myself on ADHD.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kfwyo4/is_extreme_fear_of_judgement_and_being_perceived/,1746509460.0,4
Adderall Prescription Cost,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been taking Generic Adderall and have had issues with certain generics not working as well depending on what the pharmacy could stock. My doctor wants me to try name brand. My insurance denies it because of my “age”..which is frustrating itself but with GoodRX my generic is $32, but name brand will be $200. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do to make it cheaper?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kg3smx/adderall_prescription_cost/,1746536227.0,5
Stuck in a loop and not sure why ?,"I don’t know why, but I constantly feel stuck in life. Every night, I plan things out meticulously before bed. I tell myself, “Tomorrow, I’ll get it all done.” Then I sleep, wake up... and don’t do any of it.

As the day goes on, I keep thinking, “Okay, I’ll start now.” But I don’t. Eventually, the guilt kicks in. So, I try to escape that guilt by indulging in distractions scrolling, bingeing, whatever. Then comes the guilt for that, too.

By the end of the day, I’m full of regret and tell myself, “Tomorrow for sure.” And the cycle just repeats.

Sometimes I wonder if it’s ADHD. Or am I just being lazy? Anyone else stuck in this loop?
