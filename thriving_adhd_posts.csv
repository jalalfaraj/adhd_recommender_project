Strangest/Unexpected benefit from ADHD medication?,"Anyone obtain an unexpected benefit while being on ADHD medication? 

For instance, I‚Äôve been biting my nails since childhood, but ever since I started concerta, I completely stopped. I used to get acrylic/gel nails to prevent myself gnawing at them, but now they‚Äôre natural and completely grown out. 

In a million years, I would‚Äôve never thought adhd meds would‚Äôve helped me kick this habit.",315,1746582792.0,426,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kglx3l/strangestunexpected_benefit_from_adhd_medication/,0.384,True
Workout Hack,"I‚Äôve always had trouble in the past with a consistent workout schedule. Figuring out whether I would wake up stupid early and go in the morning or muster up the energy to go after work. Because ADHD and the nature of my work makes super repeatable structure difficult, i never could cement either the morning or evening into habit long term. I found that carving out 1.5hr in the middle of the day is the sweet spot for me. My work has a gym and instead of working through lunch like i always have, i knock out my workout. I know this isn‚Äôt revolutionary but it‚Äôs helped me and I hope it helps someone else. ",13,1746577922.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kgkbo4/workout_hack/,0.8481,True
30MG Adderall E345,"So I haven't had my adderall prescription in about 3 weeks. I finally got a refill and my doc moved me from 20mg IR to 30mg IR. I was getting the round bright pink ones. I think COR 135. The new ones I got are 30mg E345 from Epic Pharma.

Anyways, the pharmacy said they could fill it in the morning but I insisted on getting it at 7pm. So i tried it, and I took maybe 1 and 1/2 and I was up till 4am playing on my computer.",1,1746628885.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kgz1mq/30mg_adderall_e345/,0.4854,True
A meditation/calming technique I accidentally stumbled upon.,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is a ‚Äúno-duh‚Äù kind of situation, but it‚Äôs a breakthrough for me. Hopefully it can be helpful to some others here.
I have tried many times over the years to meditate. I used to think that it should involve clearing my mind, being completely empty of thoughts. Well, obviously that‚Äôs not going to happen, especially not with my ADHD. I have a constant stream of visual and audible noise going on in my head, and trying to suppress it all is like trying to grab smoke.
Here‚Äôs what eventually worked for me. Instead of eliminating the sensory flow in my head, I fill it with something benign. Specifically, I imagine a circle that expands and contracts with my breathing, and I think ‚Äúin‚Äù and ‚Äúout‚Äù as I do so. This ‚Äúblocks‚Äù the passages that are normally filled with complete chaos. I give them something boring to do, rather than trying to ignore them. This lets my mind stay busy while also letting me find some peace and quiet. Obviously my mind will want to wander away from the circle, but that‚Äôs just part of the practice. And I find it‚Äôs much easier to bring my thoughts back to a thought rather than pushing my thoughts down.
This technique has helped me sleep when I otherwise struggled. And it has helped me to calm down at times when I need it.",4,1746542514.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kg67ed/a_meditationcalming_technique_i_accidentally/,0.9083,True
I built a focus timer app because I was tired of bloated ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù tools,"Lately I‚Äôve been trying to simplify the way I work. Most time management apps I tried felt‚Ä¶ overdesigned. Too many features, subscriptions, popups. I just wanted something that helped me focus, nothing else.

So I made my own. It‚Äôs a simple Pomodoro-style timer with ambient sounds ‚Äì no ads, no premium features, just tap and go. It‚Äôs called *Rhythmiq*. I made it mostly for myself, but maybe someone here finds it useful too.

Sometimes being kind (to others AND yourself) actually pays off - a small win,"Last night I came home in a good mood and found my teenage daughter with ADHD still playing Minecraft at midnight on a school night. Instead of immediately getting frustrated (my usual reaction), I asked how she was doing.

She confessed she couldn't bring herself to make her bed with the clean sheets, despite wanting to. When I went to help, I found what I call an ""ADHD nest"" - a chaotic collection of everything that had accumulated there over who knows how long.

Normally this would trigger me big time, but tonight I chose compassion instead. I helped her clean up without judgment, gave her a hug, and sent her to bed feeling supported rather than shamed.

Then I went to my room and found... my own ADHD nest waiting for me. At first I felt sad that I didn't have someone to help me the way I'd helped my daughter. But then it hit me - I could be that person for myself too.

So I cleaned up my space with the same patience and kindness I'd just shown my daughter. Went to bed feeling pretty good about breaking the frustration cycle, even if just for one night.

Just wanted to share this small win. Sometimes choosing the kinder path (even when it feels harder in the moment) actually leaves everyone feeling better, including yourself.",7,1746512370.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kfxnxe/sometimes_being_kind_to_others_and_yourself/,0.9901,True
Tricks to keep you on your workout routine?,"I learned that the best routine is the one that you can stick to, and while I can stick to it for a good month, after that I start to wane by only working areas I feel need help, then probably skip it for a month, before realizing I haven't worked out for a month then get right back onto the bandwagon again.

Yay for drugs! (Legal ones),"I've flagged it a celebration because it's been 5 months in the making.... but I finally have medication!! (I'm 99% sure my doctor mucked up somewhere through the giving me medication process but I also really mucked up by not following up and pushing for it).

Never ending hyperfixations about making art,"
 Every month or so I get a hyperfixation about making some form of art. 

I get an idea and im like Ok! this is the type of art I wanna make, then I research everything about it, and start learning how to make that art and get super excited that I finally found what I want to do. 

 Right now l'm interested in self portraits but I'm like what the point if im gonna abandon this in a week.

I tried drawing, making short films, Dj'jng, making beats, playing piano, guitar, making animations, photography..

I'm REALLY getting angry at myself because I could have already learned how to make some sort of art but instead of that I just have a head full of ideas that never make it out to the real world. I wish I could just start making art and stick to my ideas, I feel like I have a lot to say and I could make meaningful art but because my brain works like this I just feel useless.
 

Does anyone have a similar problem? Do you have any advice on how to start working with these hyperfixations? Maybe starting medication would help?

Strattera gave me a sore throat???,"Alright so I've recently started trying non stimulants for my ADHD. Unfortunately my body cannot handle stimulants (my heart races, I get a headache, get panic attacks, etc) and strattera was the first medication that was prescribed to me. The first day I had some stomach pains but I powered through and it totally got better the next few days. I did experience some burping which would lead me to assume something was going on with my stomach but I thought nothing of it. Fast forward about a week in and my throat starts to hurt. So I stopped taking it. My throat is starting to feel better today. I wasn't sick. No other symptoms. Just a sore throat. I told my psych and I'm going to be prescribed Qelbree. Really hoping I don't get sides from it. But could the sore throat have been caused by the strattera??? It's just such a random thing to have.",1,1746493751.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kfsabj/strattera_gave_me_a_sore_throat/,0.2524,True
HELP! Focus vs emotional regulation,"So I have been struggling for a while with my medications choice. Vyvanse wasn‚Äôt for me. So I have tried methylphenidate and dex (tentin). The methylphenidate is great to be focus and get shit done but in terms of how I feel about myself and socially it‚Äôs not ideal make me quite angry and I don‚Äôt really recognize myself. On the other hand, dex has been great to regulate my emotion and it has completely shed my anxieties away and has quieted my mind which has improved my social skills by a 1000. However when it comes to get work done, it almost feels more of a struggle than when I am not medicated - I become so passive even when there is something urgent to get done. Anyone had a similar experiences? And maybe found a solution that works for them? Just looking for different perspective and the choices people made.

Switching from Adderall to Vyvanse?,"I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs still a Vyvanse shortage going on. I‚Äôve been on Adderall for a while, but it feels like it‚Äôs not very effective anymore. I‚Äôve been considering switching. Back in September my doctor prescribed me a 7 day trial of Vyvanse 60mg, and I feel like it helped me, but I had to wait a few days for my pharmacy to restock. Rather than go through the trouble of having to call around and wait for every refill, I decided to continue my Adderall for the time being. 

Now that it‚Äôs been a few months I‚Äôve been thinking of giving Vyvanse another try- just hoping it‚Äôs easier to find now. I‚Äôm located in southeastern VA. ",1,1746465894.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kfhe38/switching_from_adderall_to_vyvanse/,0.8517,True
My thoughts never stop‚Äîthinking of an AI ‚Äúthought‚Äëdump‚Äù app. Would it help?,"Hi all!

I‚Äôm Daniel, a data scientist with mild‚Äëto‚Äëmoderate ADHD. Most days I hop from task to task, or sink time into random rabbit holes, and then‚Äîright in the middle of the night‚Äîmy brain wakes up and replays every unfinished thing. It‚Äôs exhausting, and the next morning I‚Äôm still untangling the mess. üòÖ

Because I can code a little (and AI has actually been handy for focus), I‚Äôm toying with a small side‚Äëproject: 

‚Ä¢	Dump anything, anytime‚Äîtext, half sentences, even voice rambles so i can quickly empty my brain but still feel something is keeping the info. 

‚Ä¢	The app would learn my usual topics (or I could specify them) and quietly sort everything into buckets‚Äîwork ideas, errands, creative sparks, etc. 

‚Ä¢	Later, I could flag a thought as an ‚ÄúAction,‚Äù and the AI could break it into smaller steps and set gentle reminders so I finally finish things.

Nothing exists yet!! And before I sink more late nights into it: 

‚Ä¢	Does this resonate with you? Or is this just some crazy useless idea? 

‚Ä¢	What part of the capture‚Äë‚Äë>sort‚Äë‚Äë>act chain trips you up the most? 

‚Ä¢	Are there features you‚Äôd absolutely love‚Äîor hate‚Äîin something like this? Or something reaaally missing?

I‚Äôm not selling anything, just trying to see if this itch is shared. Honest stories, frustrations, or ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what would actually help me‚Äù ideas are pure gold.

Thanks for sharing headspace with me. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Online Learning,"I need tips for asynchronous online learning platforms like Udemy/Linkedin Learning. I struggle to grasp the concepts being discussed. Seems like things don't stick.

General Prescription Questions,"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and given a prescription, but my mom took me off it cause of she said I seemed like less of a kid. Throughout childhood, I was always bored in class and getting in trouble at school for not paying attention/messing around, but I kept good grades, so my mom saw no reason for the prescription. Last year, transitioning to college, I struggled significantly. With fewer lectures and more independent reading and homework, I found myself constantly distracted and unable to focus, especially when studying.

After discussing this with my mom, I learned about my childhood ADHD diagnosis. I decided to make an appointment, and my doctor prescribed me 10mg IR D-Amphetamine Salt Combo(about a year and a half ago), but I haven't noticed any real difference in my focus or attention. To be honest, I'm not even sure what differences I should expect. I'm still regularly distracted during lectures and sometimes space out during boring conversations. So, I'm just looking for some general advice and information from others who may have similar experiences. (I'm planning on talking to my doctor more in depth at my next appointment but for now I figured I'd ask some questions here) Specifically, I'm wondering:

1. Are there different ADHD medications designed for specific situations, or is it mainly just varying doses of Adderall type drugs? 
2. Should I talk to my doctor about raising my prescription?
3. Does the type of doctor that I'm prescribed by matter? Currently, I see my primary care physician. Should I see a specialist and do a reevaluation?
4. If I continue my prescription long-term, will I become increasingly dependent on it?
5. Out of concern about potential long-term effects, I often skip taking my medication on weekends. Could this affect its overall effectiveness?

Pretty brief background info because of character limit but I'd be happy to elaborate on any section if it would help. Thank you!",1,1746325980.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ke9j6o/general_prescription_questions/,0.9288,True
